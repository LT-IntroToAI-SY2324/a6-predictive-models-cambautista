# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?

The r squared value is the correlation between the variables. This determines whether or not there is a strong correlation or not.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?

It is around 137.4

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

It could be accurate but the correlation between the variables is not strong as the r value is not close to 1 or -1. More data can help determine if there is a strong correlation or not, therefore improving the model and making it more accurate.
