# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
When the program was run, I was actually able to see the graph (but that was probably just a technical problem on my end). The display of line of best fit of the predicted values based on the data is more effectuve in allowing the reader to guess what someones bloodpressure will be based on their age.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The r squared coefficient tells you how correlated the data is.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I think the model is accurate as it matches some expected numbers I found on a chart online.
